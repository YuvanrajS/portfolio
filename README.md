# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The project was bootstrapped with **Create React App**.

---

## 🚀 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

---

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

---

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

The build is optimized and minified, and ready to be deployed.

---

### `npm run eject`
⚠️ **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back.

This copies all configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you have full control.
